# üì• Apple Shortcuts Import Files

> **Ready-to-import .shortcut files for instant setup**

Unfortunately, I cannot generate actual .shortcut files directly, but here are the **exact configurations** you can copy-paste into Shortcuts app, plus import links when available.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Method

### Method 1: Import via iCloud Links

**Note**: These would be actual iCloud sharing links if the shortcuts existed. You'll need to create them manually using the exact configurations below.

### Method 2: JSON Configuration Files

Here are the exact JSON structures for each shortcut that you can reference:

## üì± Core Shortcut: "Log Water Amount"

## üì± Import Instructions

**Since .shortcut files can't be generated here, you'll need to:**

1. **Create each shortcut manually** using the JSON configs above
2. **Copy the exact action sequences** 
3. **Match the timing and text** precisely
4. **Test each component** before activating all automations

**Pro Tip**: Create one automation first, test it for a day, then add the rest to avoid notification overload during setup.

This manual setup will give you the exact same persistent, zero-friction hydration system as the macOS version!
